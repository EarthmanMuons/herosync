# herosync

**Download, combine, and publish GoPro videos with ease.**

---

A tool for automating GoPro video transfers. Download media files over WiFi,
combine chapters into complete videos, clean up storage, and optionally publish
to YouTube. Designed for hands-free operation via cron jobs or interactive use
with detailed status reporting.

## Caveats

`herosync` was designed specifically for my niche use case and will likely **not
function out of the box** for more common workflows without additional
configuration.

For reference, my setup includes:

- Running the [GoPro Labs firmware](https://gopro.com/en/us/info/gopro-labs).
- Using a _GoPro HERO13_; older models may lack support for some
  [Labs extensions](https://gopro.github.io/labs/control/extensions/) that
  `herosync` depends on.
- Enabling the
  [Camera on Home Network](https://gopro.github.io/OpenGoPro/ble/features/cohn.html)
  (COHN) feature, eliminating the need for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) pairing
  before WiFi connection.
- Configuring the "Open Network" (`OPNW=1`) setting for faster HTTP access
  without requiring HTTPS or basic authentication.
- Not preserving [GPMF telemetry data](https://gopro.github.io/gpmf-parser/), as
  itâ€™s not needed for my workflow.
- Keeping my GoPro **always on** and continuously powered via USB.
