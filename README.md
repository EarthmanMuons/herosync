### YouTube Authorization Credentials

In order to access YouTube programatically for publishing, you'll need to turn
on the _YouTube Data API_ for your Google account:

1. Use [this wizard](https://console.developers.google.com/start/api?id=youtube)
   to create or select a project in the Google Developers Console and
   automatically turn on the API. Click **Continue**, then **Go to
   credentials**.

2. On the **Create credentials** page, click the **Cancel** button.

3. At the top of the page, select the **OAuth consent screen** tab. Select an
   **Email address**, enter a **Product name** if not already set, and click the
   **Save** button.

4. Select the **Credentials** tab, click the **Create credentials** button and
   select **OAuth client ID**.

5. Select the application type **Other**, enter the name "herosync", and click
   the **Create** button.

6. Click **OK** to dismiss the resulting dialog.

7. Click the **(Download JSON)** button to the right of the client ID.

8. Move the downloaded file to your herosync config directory and rename it
   `client_secret.json`.

These steps were adapted from the upstream
[Go Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/go)
documentation.

### YouTube Category IDs

Every video requires a _Category ID_, which by default is `"22"` for **People &
Blogs**. Here are the assignable ID's for reference:

| Category              | ID  |
| --------------------- | --- |
| Autos & Vehicles      | 2   |
| Comedy                | 23  |

## Caveats

`herosync` was designed specifically for my niche use case and will likely **not
function out of the box** for more common workflows without additional
configuration.

For reference, my setup includes:

- Running the [GoPro Labs firmware](https://gopro.com/en/us/info/gopro-labs).
- Using a _GoPro HERO13_; older models may lack support for some
  [Labs extensions](https://gopro.github.io/labs/control/extensions/) that
  `herosync` depends on.
- Enabling the
  [Camera on Home Network](https://gopro.github.io/OpenGoPro/ble/features/cohn.html)
  (COHN) feature, eliminating the need for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) pairing
  before WiFi connection.
- Configuring the "Open Network" (`OPNW=1`) setting for faster HTTP access
  without requiring HTTPS or basic authentication.
- Not preserving [GPMF telemetry data](https://gopro.github.io/gpmf-parser/), as
  itâ€™s not needed for my workflow.
- Keeping my GoPro **always on** and continuously powered via USB.
